Snakes and Ladders is a traditional game of Indian origin (Gyan Chauper or ज्ञान चौपड़ in Hindi) in which players (let's assume 2) must complete a path on a 10x10 board. Both players start at square 0 (outside the board) and take turns according to the following rules:


At the beginning of their turn, the player whose turn it is rolls a die and advances by the number of spaces indicated. After moving, the player checks the square they have landed on:


If the square contains the base of a 🪜ladder, then they immediately jump to the square at the top of the 🪜ladder.

If the square contains the head of a 🐍snake, then they slide back to the square with the tail of the 🐍snake.

If the player rolled a 6, they also take the next turn; otherwise, the turn passes to the other player. A player continues to roll the die and move as long as they roll a 6.
The first player to reach or exceed square 100 wins.



The eight 🪜ladders (base, top) are located at the following squares: (1,38) (4,14) (8,30) (21,42) (28,76) (50,67) (71,92) (80,99)

The seven 🐍snakes (head, tail) are located at the following squares: (32,10) (36,6) (48,26) (62,18) (88,24) (95,56) (97,78)
